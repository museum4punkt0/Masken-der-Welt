# Masken-der-Welt


Description 
------------------
The museum "Fasnachtsmuseum Schloss Langenstein" offers a broad variety of masks from all around the globe. The goal of the AR-application "Masken der Welt" is to provide the visitors an immersive insight of the culture of wearing masks on different continents and the specific context of the various according cults. 

Therefor a specific selection of masks has been 3D scanned into 3D objects (via photogrammetry), seperated from their respective textures and merged into a animated and interactive 3D modelled scene of an abstracted globe and enriched with photos, videos and further informations. 

This application is designed for running exclusively on the Microsoft (r) HoloLens (r) augmented reality glass gear. 

The application and the 3D scans of the masks have been made by contexagon and the assets were designed and created by Daniel Boehme as part of the project museum4punkt0 - Digital Strategies for the Museum of the Future, sub-project Fasnacht Digital. Further information: www.museum4punkt0.de/en/. <br>

The project museum4punkt0 is funded by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media in accordance with a resolution issued by the German Bundestag (Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany).

Technical Documentation 
-------------------------
This project is exclusively runnable on the Microsoft HoloLens MK1 AR gear. It has been made using the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit as a plugin in Unity 3D. The application, especially the interaction and behaviour routines are written in C# and the animation models have been aranged and directed in Unity 3D. Furthermore the application is using plugins for handling FBX files. The assets have been made in Cinema 4d (3D models, textures and fixed animations).  <br>

This version was made with Unity 2018.4.18f1.<br>

Download/Clone the project from https://github.com/museum4punkt0/Masken-der-Welt.<br>

Open the project using Unity Hub.<br>

Select as Build-Target "Microsoft HoloLens" in File->Build Settings <br>

Pair the HoloLens with your computer. <br>

Build and deploy the application on your HoloLens. <br>

Start the application "Masken der Welt" in the start menu of your HoloLens <br><br>



Unity projects are often quite tricky to merge from Git repositories. Therefor we decided to commit the entire workspace including caches, metadata and libs. So we recommend to check out the entire branch and select the files you need to get it up and running in your Unity version.
